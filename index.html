Fall asleep on the washing machine lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep or massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet i am the best. Sleep in the bathroom sink. Toy mouse squeak roll over. Howl on top of tall thing if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish. Jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves meowing chowing and wowing always hungry.
